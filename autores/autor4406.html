You hope that you choose jobs that will get you some more star power so you can continue to work.  That’s pretty much how it works.  I’m happy to be on the show, man.  Even though I’m only recurring, I’m not a series regular on it or anything like that, but I’ve had some great opportunities and worked with some really great people, and we’ll see how long that goes.&quot;</p><p>* ''&quot;Eu originalmente, eu estava filmando um filme, um filme independente, e eu acabei de terminar Terriers; Eu não tenho certeza se você se lembra daquele show com Shawn Ryan.
