<h1>Jesse Owens</h1><br><h4> [[Jesse Owens|James Cleveland Owens]]''' ''(Oakville, Alabama, [[12 de setembro]] de [[1913]] - Tucson, Arizona, [[31 de março]] de [[1980]]), popularmente conhecido como '''Jesse Owens''', foi um popular atleta e líder civil estadunidense, vencedor de quatro medalhas de ouro nos [[w:Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 1936|Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 1936]], disputados em Berlim, Alemanha.'' </h4><hr><hr><br><p>* &quot;The battles that count aren't the ones for gold medals. The struggles within yourself — the invisible, inevitable battles inside all of us — that's where it's at.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;When I passed the Chancellor he arose, waved his hand at me, and I waved back at him. I think the writers showed bad taste in criticizing the man of the hour in Germany.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;I realized now that militancy in the best sense of the word was the only answer where the black man was concerned, that any black man who wasn't a militant in 1970 was either blind or a coward.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;Joe Louis and I were the first modern national sports figures who were black... But neither of us could do national advertising because the South wouldn't buy it. That was the social stigma we lived under.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;We used to have a lot of fun. We never had any problems. We always ate. The fact that we didn't have steak? Who had steak?&quot;</p><p>* &quot;I wanted no part of politics. And I wasn't in Berlin to compete against any one athlete. The purpose of the Olympics, anyway, was to do your best. As I'd learned long ago... the only victory that counts is the one over yourself.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;After I came home from the 1936 Olympics with my four medals, it became increasingly apparent that everyone was going to slap me on the back, want to shake my hand or have me up to their suite. But no one was going to offer me a job.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;It's like having a pet dog for a long time. You get attached to it, and when it dies you miss it.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;The road to the Olympics, leads to no city, no country. It goes far beyond New York or Moscow, ancient Greece or Nazi Germany. The road to the Olympics leads — in the end — to the best within us.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler ... You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the 24-karat friendship I felt for Lutz Long at that moment. Hitler must have gone crazy watching us embrace. The sad part of the story is I never saw Long again. He was killed in World War II.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn't ride in the front of the bus. I had to go to the back door. I couldn't live where I wanted. I wasn't invited to shake hands with Hitler, but I wasn't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either.&quot;</p>
