[[Machado de Assis]], no conto &quot;o Espelho&quot;, faz uma alusão a uma de suas obras.'' </h4><hr><hr><br><p>* “If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.”</p><p>* &quot;One half of the world must sweat and groan that the other half may dream.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;Sometimes we may learn more from a man's errors, than from his virtues.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;There's nothing in this world so sweet as love, and next to love the sweetest thing is hate.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;The strength of criticism lies in the weakness of the thing criticized.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;People demand freedom only when they have no power.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;Most people would succeed in small things if they were not troubled with great ambitions.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;It takes less time to do a thing right, than it does to explain why you did it wrong.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth.&quot;</p><p>* &quot;O hoje e o ontem são as pedras com que construímos.&quot;</p><p>*&quot;Faz-me bem ser um pouco ressequido pelo calor e encharcado pela [[chuva]] de [[vida]]&quot;</p><p>*&quot;Em cada [[vida]] alguma [[chuva]] deve cair, e alguns [[dia]]s devem ser escuros e sombrios&quot;.</p>
